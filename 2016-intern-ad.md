# Seeking 2016 interns

The Tampa Bay Times data team is looking for fantastic young data journalists, web designers and news-minded hackers to be interns or fellows with us in 2016.

Our seven-person team analyzes data to [inform and improve the world](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/). We also use web development to experiment with better ways to [tell news stories online](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/florida-mental-health-hospitals/cuts/). And we write computer code that helps our traditional newsroom do impactful journalism in a digital era — in both how we find stories and how we present them.

Our interns tackle big ambitious projects as full-fledged members of the team. The intern who started here in January spent the last 10 months analyzing data and building graphics to show [what happened to black children when our schools resegregated](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/chart-failing-black-students/). The intern who started in June has rewritten much of our longform-story infrastructure, learned to both analyze data and make d3 charts, and shared bylines on front-page stories about [presidential fundraising](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/the-money-race-jeb-bush-marco-rubio-come-up-big-in-florida/2237817).

Our next intern could be a great reporter who finds watchdog stories in spreadsheets. Or a web designer / graphics maven with innovative ideas about digital storytelling. Or a statistics / computer science student who wants to use those skills to inform the public. You *don’t* have to be a journalist right now. You *do* have to want to be one.

You must have skill at data reporting, web development, infographics or statistics. Aside from that, we have one main criteria: You’re already great at one thing. You want to be great at more.

Coming here means joining a newsroom filled with young talent and seasoned veterans willing to mentor. You get to live by the beach and cover Florida, America’s most divine state for news, where [a mayoral race being decided with a deck of cards](http://www.gq.com/story/florida-mayoral-election-deck-of-cards?mbid=social_twitter) was the [second-craziest thing](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/gone-viral/os-florida-teacher-porn-class-20151103-post.html) that happened last week.

We’re offering three-month internships at $450 a week, dates flexible. For the right candidate we’d consider a six-month fellowship at a higher salary.

Sound like you? Send us:

* A resume
* A cover letter. Tell us what your dream internship on our team would look like. Then pick one thing from [this list of projects our paper has done](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15QzBZ7DSXrIcyotLoDG0L8e9QwQfkG38w7QHPPpaKEM/pub), and tell us how your skills could have helped make it better.
* Clips/work samples. A clip could be a published story, a web page you built, a graphic you made or your GitHub account. It could be a crazy multitenancy Node.js app. It could be a really gripping flowchart. Show us your best work, whatever form it takes.

Email your application by end of day Sunday, Dec. 6, with the subject line “data team internship,” to:
